You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.


Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true


SOLUTION :
//Algorithm
Create a new array with a 0 prepended and appended to the original flowerbed.
Iterate through the padded array from index 1 to length-2 (the original positions).
For each position, check if the current cell and both neighbors are empty (all zeros).
If so, plant a flower by setting the current cell to 1, and decrement n.
After processing all positions, return true if n is 0 or less (we placed enough flowers).
//program:
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int m = flowerbed.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int l = i == 0 ? 0 : flowerbed[i - 1];
            int r = i == m - 1 ? 0 : flowerbed[i + 1];
            if (l + flowerbed[i] + r == 0) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                --n;
            }
        }
        return n <= 0;
    }
}
